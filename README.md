## Summary
 - Despite having dynamic platform, the site apprently is less userfriendly. The most prominent part is its poor search parameters making it more difficult for analyss.
 - A basic feature of clearing viewed data is needed including a refresh button. ![SearchParam](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93893263/167286735-71f3f392-a951-425b-9891-6cff84854c7c.png)
